| Character Codes
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| character_codes:
| This is used in the automatic generation of character codes.
| {category}: This is replaced by the character category code.
| {number}: This is replaced by the character number.
/ {year}: This is replaced by the current year.
|
| e.g. Under the default setting ({category}-{number}),
| a character in a category called "MYO" (code "MYO") with number 001
| will have the character code of MYO-001.
|
| !IMPORTANT!
| As this is used to generate the character's URL, sticking to
| alphanumeric, hyphen (-) and underscore (_) characters
| is advised.
|
| character_number_digits:
| This specifies the default number of digits for {number} when
| pulled automatically.
|
| e.g. If the next number is 2, setting this to 3 would give 002.
|
| character_pull_number:
| This determines if the next {number} is pulled from the highest
| existing number, or the highest number in the category.
| This value can be "all" (default) or "category".
|
| e.g. if the following characters exist:
| Standard (STD) category: STD-001, STD-002, STD-003
| MYO (MYO) category:MYO-001, MYO-002
| If character_pull_number is 'all':
| The next number pulled will be 004 regardless of category.
| If character_pull_number is 'category':
| The next number pulled for STD will be 004.
| The next number pulled for MYO will be 003.
|
| reset_character_status_on_transfer:
| This determines whether owner-set character status--
| trading, gift art, and gift writing--
| should be cleared when the character is transferred to a new owner.
| Default: 0/Disabled, 1 to enable.
|
| reset_character_profile_on_transfer:
| This determines whether character name and profile should be cleared
| when the character is transferred to a new owner.
| Default: 0/Disabled, 1 to enable.
|
| clear_myo_slot_name_on_approval:
| Whether the "name" given to a MYO slot should be cleared when a design update for it is approved/
| the slot becomes a full character.
| Default: 0/Disabled, 1 to enable.
