      <h1> What is a Somnivore? </h1>
  </hr>
</div>


<div class="card-text">
      <h2> Somnivores are small magical creatures that eat dreams! </h2>
      <p>Their primary form is that of a small bat-like creature; their most distinct features being their dazzling horns and
        wings
        which are made of the dream essence they consume. Other notable features include their bat ears, fangs, and thin, long
        tails
        that end in a tuft of fur.
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p> Similar to their vampire ancestors, somnivores possess the ability to shapeshift from their bat form into a humanoid -
        this is referred to as their demon form.
        <br>These demons often sport unnatural skin tones and always maintain their horns and
      spindly tail, along with many other optional features that may be translated from their bat’s appearance!

    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Somnivores sustain themselves & their magical abilities by consuming dream essence. This astral, fog-like substance forms
        around a dreamer’s head as they sleep. Dream essence consists of stars, sparkles, and clouds- all swirling slowly around
        each
        other and producing a soft glow. </p>

    <Somnivores>Every dream is unique and the resulting dream essence possesses an appearance and flavor influenced by the contents and
      feelings within.Somnivores are very picky eaters, each one having their personal palate limited to only one or two of the six core
      classifications of dream.
      <br>You can always tell which types of dreams a somnivore favors by looking at the colors displayed by
      their softly glowing
      horns and wings!</>

      <p>Reverie is the magical realm in which the vast majority of the somnivore population resides. Founded by the first colony
        of somnivores, this mysterious world is a sanctuary for magical beings where the night is eternal and the air hums with
        mana.
        <br>A lot of things we're familiar with in our everyday lives have a counterpart that exists in Reverie- though through a bit
        of a
        "dream-like" lens. Plants glow, clouds can be built on, the breeze carries stardust. Buildings and technology can almost
        appear
        cartoonish with their soft shapes and glowing parts. There’s no shortage of mystical places to visit and interesting
        things to
        do!
        <br>In a thriving age of abundant dreams, somnivores value community, leisure, and curiosity for the expanding whimsical
        world
        they reside in. </p>
