  <h1> ✨ What is a Somnivore? 🦇 </h1>
  </hr>

  <h2> Somnivores are small magical creatures that eat dreams! </h2>

  <p>Their primary form is that of a small bat-like creature; their most distinct features being their dazzling horns and wings
    which are made of the dream essence they consume. Other notable features include their bat ears, fangs, and thin, long tails
    that end in a tuft of fur.
  </p>

  <p> Similar to their vampire ancestors, somnivores possess the ability to shapeshift from their bat form into a humanoid - this
    is referred to as their demon form. These demons often sport unnatural skin tones and always maintain their horns and spindly
    tail, along with many other optional features that may be translated from their bat’s appearance!
  </p>

    💤 Dream Diet 🍹
  </h1>
  </hr>

  <p>Somnivores sustain themselves & their magical abilities by consuming dream essence. This astral, fog-like substance forms
    around a dreamer’s head as they sleep. Dream essence consists of stars, sparkles, and clouds- all swirling slowly around each
    other and producing a soft glow. </p>

    class="w-content-50"

  <p>Every dream is unique and the resulting dream essence possesses an appearance and flavor influenced by the contents and
    feelings within.</p>

  <p>Somnivores are very picky eaters, each one having their personal palate limited to only one or two of the six core
    classifications of dream. You can always tell which types of dreams a somnivore favors by looking at the colors displayed by
    their softly glowing
    horns and wings!</p>

  <hr>
  <p>Reverie is the magical realm in which the vast majority of the somnivore population resides. Founded by the first colony of
    somnivores, this mysterious world is a sanctuary for magical beings where the night is eternal and the air hums with mana. A
    lot
    of things we're familiar with in our everyday lives have a counterpart that exists in Reverie- though through a bit of a
    "dream-like" lens. Plants glow, clouds can be built on, the breeze carries stardust. Buildings and technology can almost
    appear
    cartoonish with their soft shapes and glowing parts. There’s no shortage of mystical places to visit and interesting things to
    do! In a thriving age of abundant dreams, somnivores value community, leisure, and curiosity for the expanding whimsical world
    they reside in. </p>
