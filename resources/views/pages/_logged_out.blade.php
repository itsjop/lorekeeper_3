    <hr />
    <div class="card-text">
      <h2>Somnivores are small magical creatures that eat dreams!</h2>
      <p>Their primary form is that of a small bat-like creature; their most distinct features being their dazzling horns and
        wings
        which are made of the dream essence they consume. Other notable features include their bat ears, fangs, and thin, long
        tails
        that end in a tuft of fur.</p>

      /></div>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Similar to their vampire ancestors, somnivores possess the ability to shapeshift from their bat form into a humanoid -
        this
        is referred to as their demon form. <br />These demons often sport unnatural skin tones and always maintain their horns
        and
        spindly tail, along with many other optional features that may be translated from their bat&rsquo;s appearance!</p>

    <div class="card-text">
      <p>Somnivores sustain themselves &amp; their magical abilities by consuming dream essence. This astral, fog-like substance
        forms around a dreamer&rsquo;s head as they sleep. Dream essence consists of stars, sparkles, and clouds- all swirling
        slowly around each other and producing a soft glow.</p>

    <div class="card-text">Every dream is unique and the resulting dream essence possesses an appearance and flavor influenced by
      the contents and feelings within.Somnivores are very picky eaters, each one having their personal palate limited to only one
      or two of the six core classifications of dream. <br />You can always tell which types of dreams a somnivore favors by
      looking
      at the colors displayed by their softly glowing horns and wings!</div>

      /></div>
    <div class="card-text"><br />
      <p>Reverie is the magical realm in which the vast majority of the somnivore population resides. Founded by the first colony
        of
        somnivores, this mysterious world is a sanctuary for magical beings where the night is eternal and the air hums with mana.
        <br />A lot of things we're familiar with in our everyday lives have a counterpart that exists in Reverie- though through
        a
        bit of a "dream-like" lens. Plants glow, clouds can be built on, the breeze carries stardust. Buildings and technology can
        almost appear cartoonish with their soft shapes and glowing parts. There&rsquo;s no shortage of mystical places to visit
        and
        interesting things to do! <br />In a thriving age of abundant dreams, somnivores value community, leisure, and curiosity
        for
        the expanding whimsical world they reside in.
